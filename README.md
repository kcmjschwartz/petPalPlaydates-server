# Welcome to PetPal Playdates - For people who need a pet fix and pets that need a people fix.

# User Stories

`The Animal Lover`:
	As an animal lover that lives in an apartment that doesnâ€™t allow pets, I would like to request a playdate with a pet to give them attention and satisfy my need for interaction with animals.

`The Pet Owner`:
	As a pet owner, sometimes my pet needs more attention than I can give them so I would like to list my pet for playdates to get the additional attention they deserve.



# How it Works:

1. Users Register for an Account using one of two "Get Started!" Buttons(one in the header and one in the body).  Or they login via the button in the header. Registration and Login are both down through modals.
